## Project Structure
- `public` - Contains the Extension files.
- `src` - Contains the Svelte src files.
- `public/build` - Contains JS/CSS files generated by Svelte Compiler

### src
The three root level files are in src, called `NewTab.svelte`, `Popup.svelte` and `Options.svelte`. You can map the components on the screen by going down from the root level files.

## Setting Up for Development
1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine
2. **Enable '_Developer Mode_'** on your Chrome(ium) browser at 'chrome://extensions/'
3. **Select '_Load unpacked_'** button and point it to the `public` folder
4. Experiment

## Running Scripts
- `npm run build` - builds all the extension files to `public` folder.
- `npm run dev-newtab` - Watches and rebuilds the new tab page to `public` folder on changes
- `npm run dev-popup` - Watches and rebuilds the popup section to `public` folder on changes
- `npm run dev-options` - Watches and rebuilds the options page to `public` folder on changes
- `npm run dev-all` - Watches and rebuilds the complete extension to `public` folder on changes (Will be slower).
